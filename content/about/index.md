## About

Software engineer specializing in **AI-augmented development** and **financial systems**.

I spent 6 years building backend services for Brazil's banking sector—systems where bugs cost real money and downtime isn't an option. That taught me to think in edge cases and design for failure.

Now I'm applying that rigor to a different problem: **making AI agents actually useful for coding**. Not toy demos. Real workflows that ship production code.

## Tech Stack

**AI & Agents:** LangChain, OpenAI API, Claude, autonomous agent architectures  
**Data:** Python, Spark, Airflow, Databricks, SQL  
**Backend:** .NET Core, AWS, Azure, MongoDB, Redis, RabbitMQ  
**Financial:** Payment systems, compliance, high-frequency transaction processing

## Why AI Agents?

Most developers use AI as autocomplete. I use it as a **junior dev that never sleeps**—writing boilerplate, reviewing PRs, researching docs, and flagging issues before I see them.

The goal: spend my cognitive cycles on problems worth solving.
