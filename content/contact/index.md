## What I'm Looking For

I'm focused on **remote opportunities** where I can:

- Build software using **AI agents** as development tools
- Work with teams exploring **LLM-powered workflows**
- Apply my financial systems background to complex problems
- Ship production code, not just prototypes

**Ideal roles:** Software Engineer, AI/ML Engineer, or hybrid positions where AI augmentation is part of the development culture.
